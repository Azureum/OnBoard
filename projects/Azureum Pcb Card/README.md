# Matt's PCB Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I have created a pcb card following the tutorial provided above, though I made some tweaks. It has a better chip as well as it is going to power two LEDs and those LEDs will light up when it's close to a phone due to the NFC chip.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
It is going to cost around 90$ Though the price can definitely drop.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Definitely I was originally going to stray off from the 25x48 antenna and use a 48 x 48, I still want to use the 48x48 though there was some challenges as to the wiring and I was unsure if it was even wired properly. So I went
back to using a 25 x 48 antenna. Though using 2 LEDs required me to have more power, and I needed a better chip for power harvesting as the tutorial provided a weak chip. So I had to scavage around to find a better model.
I also needed to wire it and I just crossed referenced between the I/Os between the two chips and I got it figured out.
